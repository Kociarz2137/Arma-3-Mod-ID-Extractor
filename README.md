# How to use the program?
At first you need to have the HTML list of mods that you want to turn into .txt file. If you arleady have it you can open 
the program and browse for this list of mods. Now when you choosed your list of mods you can now click "Save As" button. The txt
file should be saved in the same folder as the HTML list of mods.

# Why this is exsist?
This program is basically made when you want to install mods on your Arma 3 server beacuse many hostings like 4NetPlayers require from
you to insert the ID's of mods. When you have more than 20 mods it's a little bit tricky and you can easliy wrong copy and paste every ID of mod.
The purpose of this program is just to make installing mods on your server much easier and faster. If you using hosting like 4NetPlayers you know what I am talking about.

# How to install the program?
